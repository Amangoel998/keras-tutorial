- Image Classification Models
- Use Directly for trained classes
    - Use these models in several ways such as to identify objects in our images that match model's trained classes
- Retrained through Transfer Learning
    - Retrain classifier in image classes
- Fine-tuning for Optimizing
    - Retrain parts of models to increase performance on image classes
