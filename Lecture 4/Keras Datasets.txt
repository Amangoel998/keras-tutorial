Keras datasets 


Objectives
- Save Time
    - Like to prepare dataset of images for training recognition algorithm , we need to go through them and determine what objects are in them and associate entries and a truth table for the image.
- Standard
    - Used by other models and are standard in their areas
    - Allows to compare performance of our models against models of others
- Reduces Workload
    - Availablity of datasets reduces Workload

Following datasets are available
